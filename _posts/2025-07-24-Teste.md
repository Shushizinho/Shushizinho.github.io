# Hyper-v

To run Hyper-v, it's necessary to meet these requirements:

- Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Home edition does not support Hyper-V natively).

- 64-bit processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).

- At least 4 GB of RAM.

- Virtualization enabled in BIOS/UEFI.


In the control Painel, go to **Programs and Features** and, in the left pane, click **Turn Windows features on or off**. Click the check Hyper-V, click Ok and restart the PC.

# Kali-linux VM

First download the kali-linux image in [kali-linux image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms) **Installer Images**.

Then, it's necessary to have an virtual network that allows the connection between the Kali VM and TryHackMe. to make this possible I created an a **New virtual network switch** in Hyper-V, an External Network connected to my Wi-Fi.

After this, I create the Kali VM using the virtual network and the kali.iso iamge and configurated the machine following [kali-VM-Configuration](https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/hard-disk-install/).

# Connection to TryHackMe

Download the configuration file in the **Access** tab of TryHackMe account. 

```
mkdir ~/vpn
mv anaSilva.ovpn ~/vpn/
```

```
sudo openvpn username.ovpn
```
