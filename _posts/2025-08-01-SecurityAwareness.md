## Introduction
This post covers the TryHackMe room "Security Awareness", which focuses on understanding the human element in cybersecurity and developing better cyber hygiene practices. The room emphasizes that security awareness is not just an IT concern but a responsibility that extends to every individual within an organization.

## Task 1: Introduction to Security Awareness

### What is Security Awareness?

Security awareness represents the foundation of organizational cybersecurity. It encompasses the knowledge, understanding, and mindset needed to recognize, respond to, and prevent cyber threats in our daily digital interactions. As employees, we serve as both the first line of defense and potentially the weakest link in our organization's security posture.

The room introduces a sobering statistic from IBM research: human errors were the primary factor in **95% of successful cyber attacks**. This finding underscores a critical reality in modern cybersecurity—while organizations invest heavily in technical security solutions like firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems, the human element remains the most vulnerable component.

### Universal Responsibility


Security awareness is not limited to IT professionals or security teams. Every employee, regardless of their role or department, can become a target for cybercriminals. This universal vulnerability stems from several factors:

- Access Privileges: Even entry-level employees often have access to sensitive systems and data.
- Insider Knowledge: Employees possess valuable information about company processes, technologies, and vulnerabilities.
- Trust Relationships: Attackers can exploit the trust employees have within organizational hierarchies.
- Digital Footprint: Personal and professional digital activities create multiple attack vectors.

## Task 2: Why Security Awareness is essential

ecurity awareness training serves multiple critical functions in organizational defense:

- Risk Mitigation: Educated employees can identify and avoid common attack vectors.
- Incident Response: Aware employees respond more effectively when security incidents occur.
- Cultural Change: Security awareness builds a security-conscious organizational culture.
- Compliance: Many regulatory frameworks require security awareness training.
- Cost Reduction: Preventing breaches is significantly more cost-effective than responding to them.

The human factor in cybersecurity cannot be eliminated, but it can be significantly strengthened through proper awareness and training programs.

## Task 3: Data and account security

How many people were affected by eBay being hacked?
> **Answer:** `145 million`

What data was leaked from Playstation being hacked?
> **Answer:** `names, addresses, e-mail, birth dates`

## Task 4: Check if you've ever been part of a cyber breach

Regular monitoring of personal data exposure is a crucial component of personal cybersecurity hygiene. Users should:

- Check their accounts regularly using breach notification services.
- Use unique passwords for different accounts.
- Enable two-factor authentication where available.
- Monitor financial statements and credit reports for unusual activity.

## Task 5: Cyber threat actors
Who would most likely be interested in exploiting a business? 
> **Answer:** `Cybercriminals` <br>
Cybercriminals typically operate with sophisticated organizational structures, often resembling legitimate businesses. They invest in research and development, maintain customer service operations for their victims, and continuously evolve their techniques to maximize profits.


Who would most likely be interested in exploiting a personal computer for fun? 
> **Answer:** `Thrill-seekers` <br>
These actors are often less sophisticated but can still cause significant damage. They may use readily available hacking tools without fully understanding their implications.


Who would most likely be interested in exploiting a website to deliver a message? 
> **Answer:** `Hacktivists` <br>
Hacktivist groups like Anonymous have demonstrated the ability to coordinate large-scale operations and can cause significant reputational damage to their targets.


## Task 6: Conclusion

The Security Awareness room effectively demonstrates that cybersecurity is fundamentally a human challenge. While technical solutions remain important, the human element—whether as a vulnerability or as a defense mechanism—plays the decisive role in most security outcomes.
Key Takeaways

- Human Factor Dominance: 95% of successful attacks involve human error, making security awareness critical.
- Universal Responsibility: Every employee, regardless of role, has a part to play in organizational security.
- Real-World Impact: Major breaches like eBay and PlayStation demonstrate the massive scale of modern cyber threats.
- Diverse Threat Landscape: Different threat actors have varying motivations and methods, requiring comprehensive awareness.
- Continuous Learning: Security awareness is not a one-time training but an ongoing process of education and vigilance.
