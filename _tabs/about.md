Hey! 
My name is Ana Silva and I'm currently working on improving my knowledge in the field of cybersecurity.
To achieve this, I’m combining theory with hands-on practice through various learning platforms and methodologies. Right now, I'm exploring TryHackMe rooms to strengthen my practical skills. In addition to that, I’m also taking C-Academy courses—such as the Secure Network Architect track—and actively seeking out other learning opportunities in the field.
